  ## How to play the game
  Clone the game from the github repository, have your own preferred IDE and run it, then type localhost:8080 on the browser (Chrome preferred) then the game will display, put the player names
  on the input field and click the "initialize Game" button, the pits will display and start moving the stones using pit id
  But unfortunately could not finish the game so that it could work properly and perfectly especially on the front end site although the backend functionality is complete and as well tested the
  components using unit testing.
